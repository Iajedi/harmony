## Reinventing Supermarket Membership ##
Featured at IC Hack 24 (Largest Hackathon in Europe)
### Achievement ###
**Third place** at incident.io's category: Most Magical Moment 

### Concept ###
**Combining gamification with health tracking**
1. Suppose Harmony users can link their membership to different supermarkets’ system.​
2. Each purchase will be counted and accumulated in the Harmony app for each product.
3. Once a certain number of an item has been reached, a new skin could be obtained or maybe a magical moment would occur!
